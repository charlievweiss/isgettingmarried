- question: Bears?
  answer: |
    They don't often come through town, and if they do they don't engage with people. If you see one, leave it alone and stick together. If it starts coming near you, make a lot of noise!

- question: Mosquitos?
  answer: |
    It varies by year. I, Charlie, react to them REAL BAD and apparently taste delicious, but I haven't felt a need to wear netting in town or on the beach. One step in the woods, though, and I have no skin exposed.

- question: Sunlight?
  answer: |
    It's pretty bright in Gustavus in the summer, but not Arctic Circle bright. Google says it'll be around 18 hours of functional daylight. Bring a good sleep mask!

- question: I'm trans. Is there a bathroom for me?
  answer: |
    There isn't an official gender neutral restroom at the GCC, but we're planning on putting up temporary signage so the "women's" and "mens" will be "stalls" and "stalls + urinal." We got you.

- question: Is there Uber/Lyft in Gustavus?
  answer: |
    No.

- question: Are there restaurants?
  answer: |
    Sort of! Things aren't always guaranteed, but the Sunnyside Cafe should be open. Also the Fireweed Cafe (fair warning: the owners are anti-vaxxers). The Cottonwood Cabins *might* have the restaurant finished in time. The Glacier Bay Lodge has food for its guests, but that's 10 miles away from town.

- question: Are there grocery stores?
  answer: |
    There is one grocery store! The merch will look very familiar if you've ever been to CostCo. It has the basics (dry goods, some produce, snacks, toiletries) but don't expect a lot of options. Also, it's harder to get things to Gustavus, which makes it more expensive.

- question: Is there a pharmacy?
  answer: |
    There isn't! Be very extra sure to bring your meds and not lose them!

- question: What should I wear?
  answer: |
    It's pretty moderate in the summer, in the 60s. Bring layers and prep for rain or shine.

- question: What kind of shoes should I wear?
  answer: |
    Comfy indoor shoes for the GCC, and good shoes for mud otherwise.

- question: I have a pretty seriously allergy, can you accommodate me?
  answer: |
    Yes! Get in touch with us ASAP, so we can make sure we keep any of the allergen away from you!

- question: Can I take pictures?
  answer: |
   Please no pictures during the ceremony, but take as many as youâ€™d like during the reception. Please don't post on social media <3

- question: What if I have question that is not listed here?
  answer: |
    Feel free to contact the happy couple.
