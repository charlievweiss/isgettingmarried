      <h1>Welcome To Gustavus</h1>

        We're sure many of you will want to make the most of your Alaska trip. Here's some other stuff you can do while you're here!

        <h2>Gustavus</h2>
        <p>
          Gustavus is a town of a little over 400 people, surrounded on three sides by Glacier Bay National Park, and on the fourth by Icy Strait. </p><p>
            The <a href="https://www.gustavusak.com/" target="_blank">Gustavus Visitor Association</a> is a great resource for things to do in and around town.

            <h2>Glacier Bay</h2>
            <p>
              Let's be honest though, the main attraction of Gustavus (besides Charlie and Rowan) is Glacier Bay National Park. If you come all the way here, we <i>highly</i> recommend that you see the park. The Glacier Bay Lodge offers an amazing and easy all-day boat tour where you'll go to the heart of the bay to see glaciers, stopping along the way for wildlife viewing. You might see black and brown bears, mountain goats, whales, and wolves, and you'll definitely see sea otters, sea lions, and lots of birds, including puffins! A National Park Service interpreter will be with you all day. We are thinking that many of you will find yourselves together on the boat on Saturday the 17th. <a href="https://www.visitglacierbay.com/tours/glacier-bay-day-tour/" target="_blank"> Book here.</a></p><p>
                If you want to make a longer adventure out of it, the Day Boat (above) can drop off and pick up kayakers throughout the bay as well. Check out the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/glba/index.htm" target="_blank">Glacier Bay National Park Website</a> for more ideas on what to do during your stay.
